# Unreal Engine 5 Showcase Repository

This repository is a personal showcase of my development work in Unreal Engine 5, demonstrating various features and techniques I've implemented.

## Featured Content

This repository includes the following features and content:

### 1. Updated Witcher-Style Characters

*   **Description:**  This includes updated 3D models for both male and female characters in a style reminiscent of *The Witcher* series.

### 2. Combined Slider and Progress Bar Widget

*   **Description:** This custom widget combines the functionality of a slider and progress bar for a more interactive user experience.
*   **Demonstration:** Check out the "WidgetSlider" level to see this widget in action.
*   **Location:**  The widget blueprint and related assets are located in the 'UI' folder.

### 3. Interactive Mouse Cursor Widget Spawning

*   **Description:** The 'BP_My_Character' blueprint demonstrates dynamic widget spawning based on mouse cursor location.
    *   Pressing the 'C' key will spawn a widget at the current mouse pointer location.
    *   Pressing the 'C' key again will spawn a new widget on the changed pointer location.
    *   Holding the 'C' key will move the widget dynamically along with the mouse pointer.
    *   Press 'X' to hide the widget.
*   **Location:**  Explore the blueprint `BP_My_Character` to see the implementation.
